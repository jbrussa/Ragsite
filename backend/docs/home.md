### TESTIMONIALS

Great! Pyplan currently supports the supply of finished products between factories and DCs. With its implementation, we have evolved in the way this process is carried out. Bringing state-of-the-art technology to optimize the models, allowing the planner to act in the validation of the proposal and no longer in designing it.

Brunno R.Demand and Supply Planning Executive Manager

The software is really good. Based on statistics enshrined in the literature and with agile handling tools. Although it is easy to run a model in Pyplan, making it robust and adaptable to the different characteristics of the market / segment is the real challenge. At these times, it will be necessary to develop solid databases to support Pyplan's calculations.

Guilherme F.Planning Coordinator

Pyplan as an economic/financial tool is great, with reliability of results, great stability of operation, good availability of licenses, good processing capacity, rarely problems related to the software, occasionally a problem related to the capacity of the server.

Douglas L.Planning Consulting

Excellent tool for finnacial modeling. I am satisfied with using Pyplan on a daily basis. The system is used for short-, medium- and long-term financial projections, being connected to modules on different topics, making financial modeling easier and providing confidence in the data generated.
